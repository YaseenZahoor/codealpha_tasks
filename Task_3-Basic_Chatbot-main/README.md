Create a simple chatbot using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library. It defines a set of patterns and corresponding responses.
1)It prompts the user for input, processes the input, generates a response using the chatbot, and then prints the response.
2)The chatbot can answer questions, provide information and suggest books based on the defined patterns.
3)A catch-all pattern is included, this pattern ensures that if none of the defined patterns match the user input, indicating that it didn't understand the input.
4)The conversation loop continues until the user enters "quit". Upon receiving this input, the chatbot prints a goodbye message and terminates the program.
The code demonstrates the basic implementation of a chatbot using NLTK, allowing for simple conversational interactions with users based on predefined patterns and responses.
